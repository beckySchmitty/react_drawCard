# React Card Draw Problem

I was tasked with using the Deck of Cards API to draw a card when clicking the button and then I had to change the behavior of the app, so that when you click on the button, rather than drawing a single card, the page will draw one card every second.

These draws will continue until you press the button again, or until the deck has been exhausted (at which point the alert message from Part 1 should appear). Make sure to change the button text appropriately as well (for example, it could toggle between “Start drawing” and “Stop drawing.”
